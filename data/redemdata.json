Usually the profit would have to out weigh the risk, turning all these 8ths is a lot of work and this is not including the &#39;bulk discount&#39;. In other states medical rates go for up to an exceeding $60/8th. </p>\n\n<p>Margins for legal shops would have to take into account taxes an overhead. Running a retail operation isn&#39;t cheap but there is little to no risk involved. Say they get the same rate from a partner grower. $1000/lb. Not sure of current tax rates, but I know they are high, lets say 40%. They would actually be selling 8ths for $15-$16 retail, add taxes that&#39;s $30 8th. Overhead (rent, payroll, local taxes, business tax, etc) is another beast that really eats into profits, typically for a retail outfit overhead is upwards of 50% of profits. So lets say to turn a lb of herb it&#39;d cost $2536 ((.5*$3072)+$1000) cost of goods and overhead. That would be a gross margin of 154%ish. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks!
